# TargetedUnitPopup

A library mod for [Phantom Brigade](https://braceyourselfgames.com/phantom-brigade/) to show a popup with the targeted unit when hovering over an attack action.

It is compatible with game version **1.1.2-b5993** (Epic/Steam).

A popup used to appear in the upper left corner of the screen when you hovered over an attack action. At some point in the early access phase, this was dropped from the game. It was a bit of UI that I found useful, especially in busy fights, so I've brought it back.

The popup is the same one that appears when you hover over a unit.
